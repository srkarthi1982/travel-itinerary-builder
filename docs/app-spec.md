# App Spec: travel-itinerary-builder

## 1) App Overview
- **App Name:**
- **Category:**
- **Version:**
- **App Type:** DB-backed / Local-only / Hybrid
- **Purpose:**
- **Primary User:**

## 2) User Stories
- As a `<user>`, I want to `<action>`, so that `<outcome>`.
- As a `<user>`, I want to `<action>`, so that `<outcome>`.
- As a `<user>`, I want to `<action>`, so that `<outcome>`.

## 3) Core Workflow
1. User opens `<entry route/page>`.
2. User performs `<primary action>`.
3. App validates/processes input.
4. App saves or updates state according to V1 behavior.
5. User can review, edit, filter, or reset outputs.

## 4) Functional Behavior
- `<Rule 1: deterministic behavior>`
- `<Rule 2: create/edit/delete/filter behavior>`
- `<Rule 3: visibility/access behavior>`
- `<Rule 4: route/state safety behavior>`

## 5) Data & Storage
- **Storage type:**
- **Main entities:**
- **Persistence expectations:**
- **User model:** Single-user local / Multi-user shared

## 6) Special Logic (Optional)
- AI/date/scoring/domain rules (only if implemented in V1).
- Any hard limits, thresholds, or formatting rules.

## 7) Edge Cases & Error Handling
- Invalid IDs/routes:
- Empty input:
- Unauthorized access:
- Missing records:
- Invalid payload/state:

## 8) Tester Verification Guide
### Core flow tests
- [ ] `<core scenario 1>`
- [ ] `<core scenario 2>`

### Safety tests
- [ ] `<invalid id/route handling>`
- [ ] `<empty/invalid input handling>`
- [ ] `<state recovery/reset behavior>`

### Negative tests
- [ ] `<unsupported action remains blocked/no-op>`
- [ ] `<unexpected state does not crash app>`

## 9) Out of Scope (V1)
- `<Explicitly not supported item 1>`
- `<Explicitly not supported item 2>`
- `<Explicitly not supported item 3>`

## 10) Freeze Notes
- V1 release freeze: this document defines expected behavior for QA and bug triage.
- During freeze, only verification fixes/cleanup are allowed; no undocumented feature expansion.
- Update this doc only when implemented V1 behavior changes through approved freeze work.
